Implement some simple encryption and decryption algorithms

This repo implement some simple encryption/decryption algorithms, like RSA, ElGamal, Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange, ElGamal Re-Encryption, Universal ElGamal Re-Encryption. 

1. RSA Encryption/Decryption algorithm:
    (1) Key generation

    Generate a large primes p and q

    Compute n = p*q

    Compute phi = (p-1)(q-1)

    Generate a public key e by: gcd(e, phi), set (n, e) as public key

    Generate a private key d by: e.d â‰¡ 1 mod (n), set (n, d) as private key

    (2) Encryption:

    c = ciphertext

    m = plaintext

    c = m^e mod n

    (3) Decryption:
    
    m = c^d mod n
